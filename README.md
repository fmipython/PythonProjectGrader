# PythonProjectGrader

A grader for Python projects, used in the ["Programming with Python"](https://github.com/fmipython) course at Sofia University "St. Kliment Ohridski", Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics.

Automatically grader Python projects based on a set of checks.
Current supported set of checks are:

- If the project has a requirements.txt file
- Pylint
- Type hints (via mypy)
- Code coverage (via pytest & coverage)

The tool supports configuration files, where you can specify the score for each check.

The tool is still WIP:

- Add unit tests
- Add functional tests
- Add documentation
- Add Github workflows
