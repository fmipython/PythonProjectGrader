# PythonProjectGrader

A grader for Python projects

Automatically grader Python projects based on a set of checks.
Current supported set of checks are:

- If the project has a requirements.txt file
- Pylint
- Type hints (via mypy)
- Code coverage (via pytest & coverage)

The tool supports configuration files, where you can specify the score for each check.

The tool is still WIP:

- Add actually loading things from the configuration file
- Add unit tests
- Add functional tests
- Add documentation
- Add Github workflows
